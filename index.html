        		<h1>Hi there, my name is Katie!</h1>
				<p>Here's a little bit about me:</p>
				<p>I'm one of (probably) many <em>struggling students</em> in the world and I happen to attend <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">UBC</a>.
				I've just completed my second year in my studies to pursue a Bachelor's degree in computer science. But enough about that...
				Time for the fun stuff. The most important things to me are my family and friends, and my ultimate goal in life is <em>happiness</em>.
				I think the whole point of living is for "the pursuit of happiness." You know, you go through life looking for things and people
				that make you happy, and when you find them, you don't let go.</p>
				<p>I care a lot about the environment. I like going on hikes. I've been trying to do the grouse grind annually ever since
				the first time I climbed it when I was in grade 8 with my dad and my sister.
				At the top of my bucket list is seeing the northern lights. And a bunch of other random things I'd like to do are: learn
				archery, learn how to shoot a gun, learn how to ride a horse, hike Garibaldi Lake</p>.
				In my spare time, I like to go out. Here's a random fact: I get scared easily. Although being alone outside in the middle of the
				night when it's dark out scares me, it's kind of my favourite time to be outside because it's quiet and calm and there's no one around.
				(I'm not sure what it is exactly.. but it's so much scarier being outside when it's dark vs in the daylight. I'm more scared of being
				kidnapped and attacked by bears/coyotes/various animals at this time.) I've always been more of a night person. I was never a morning
				person. I wish I was. To take advantage of the daylight. It's said that you can train yourself to be a morning person. Anyways, I've
				recently discovered that the time right before sunrise is perfect for me. The sky is getting lighter at that time, so it's not so dark out,
				but there also aren't very many people around.
				Sometimes, I'll pass by a school or a park and I'll see children running around and playing, and it'll remind me of my childhood when
				I used to do the same. Often, I'll wish I had my old friends to run around and play tag or Cops and Robbers with.
				It is a bad habit to binge watch tv shows. Shows I currently watch include The 100, Game of Thrones and Brooklyn Nine Nine.
